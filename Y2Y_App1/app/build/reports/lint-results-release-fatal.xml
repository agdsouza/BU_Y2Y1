    <issue
        id="UniquePermission"
        severity="Fatal"
        message="Permission name `C2D_MESSAGE` is not unique (appears in both `com.y2y.android.C2D_MESSAGE` and `com.y2y.android.permission.C2D_MESSAGE`)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Permission names are not unique"
        explanation="The unqualified names or your permissions must be unique. The reason for this is that at build time, the `aapt` tool will generate a class named `Manifest` which contains a field for each of your permissions. These fields are named using your permission unqualified names (i.e. the name portion after the last dot).&#xA;&#xA;If more than one permission maps to the same field name, that field will arbitrarily name just one of them.">
